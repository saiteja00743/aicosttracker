### 🚀 Key Features

#### 🧠 Dynamic Audit Engine
A deterministic, rule-based engine that evaluates user stacks against real-world pricing data. It identifies plan mismatches (e.g., 2 users on a 5-seat minimum Team plan) and suggests consolidation opportunities.

#### ⚡ AI-Powered Summaries
Integrated with **Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet** to generate narrative, executive-ready summaries of potential savings. Features a zero-latency fallback system for 100% uptime.

#### 📈 Benchmark Mode
Allows users to compare their AI spend per developer against industry averages for Seed, Growth, and Enterprise stages, creating a psychological hook for AI Cost Tracker's services.

#### 🔗 Viral Shareability
Dynamic `/report/[id]` routes with custom-generated Open Graph metadata for high-quality previews on Twitter, Slack, and LinkedIn.

### 🏗️ Engineering Decisions

- **Why Tailwind v4?** Utilized the new `@theme` architecture to centralize design tokens directly in CSS, reducing configuration overhead.
- **Why Supabase?** Rapid iteration speed and built-in Row Level Security (RLS) allowed for a secure, production-ready backend within the 7-day sprint.
- **Deterministic Logic:** Chose hardcoded rules for the audit math over LLM-based calculations to ensure financial accuracy and defensibility.
